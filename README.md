# running the code
To run the code either run the start.bat file (you wont be able to see the 
simulation stats before it exits) or open the terminal and navigate to this 
folder (so that you can see all the config files and the source code files) 
and run the following command:
  python3 main.py

# Logs generated by the simulation
Every time a simulation is run, logs will be generated and stored in the logs
folder. In the logs folder, you will see a .csv file for the following:
    - each check in queue
    - each security queue
    - passengers
    - planes
The .csv files have a title row so what each column represents should be clear
In addition, there is a log.txt file that contains data relating to all
aspects of the simulation in the order it occurs. It is harder to read.

# modifying the simulation variables
You have the choice to either edit a configuration file or answer a set of 
yes/no questions in the terminal. Note that if you do not use the configuration 
file, your configuration options are MUCH MORE LIMITED.

When the simulation runs, you can click enter twice to use the default configuration (pulling values from config.cfg)

If you want to change the simulation parameters, we suggest that you edit the 
config.cfg file that we have provided. If you wish to make another config file 
(or run one of our prebuilt config files such as suggestion3.cfg) then the 
simulation will provide you an opportunity to type the name of the file after 
you select you want to load a configuration file.

The configuration file allows you to adjust the following settings:

universalqueuepolicy - this parameter determins how universal checkin desks and 
    universal security desks chose the next passenger to serve
    1 = pick randomly
    2 = pick alternating
    3 = prefer business class
    4 = prefer coach class
coachcheckin - number of checkin desks that only serve coach passengers
businesscheckin - number of checkin desks that only serve business passengers
universalcheckin - number of checkin desks that serve both coach and business 
    passengers
coachsecurity - number of security desks that only serve coach passengers
businesssecurity - number of security desks that only serve coach passengers
universalsecurity - number of security desks that only serve both coach and 
    provincial passengers

simlength - number of days that will be simulated
commutercap - maximum number of commuters that will be generated
commuterrate - average number of commuters that arrive every hour

logqueue - whether to log queue-related information to a file (0 or 1)
logplane - whether to log plane-related information to a file (0 or 1)
logpassenger - whether to log passenger-related information to a file (0 or 1)
printqueue - whether to log queue-related information to the terminal (0 or 1)
printplane - whether to log plane-related information to the terminal (0 or 1)
printpassenger - whether to log passenger-related information to the terminal 
    (0 or 1)

commuterinterval - time in minuites between commuter flights
commuterseats - number of coach seats available on commuter planes
provincialinterval - time in minuites between provincial flights
provincialcoachcount - number of coach seats available on provincial planes
provincialcoachchance - probability for a provincial coach seat to be filled
provincialbusinesschance - probability for a provincial business seat to be filled
provincialbusinesscount - number of business seats available on commuter planes
provincialarrivalmean - mean time that provincial passengers arrive early
provincialarrivalvariation - varience for the time that provincial passengers 
    arrive early (they arrive according to a normal distribution)
